This assignment will be graded using unit tests executed via the submit script that you run on your computer. To obtain the submit script, run the following code in R:

source("http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/submitscript4.R")

Or you can download the script to your working directory and source it locally via

source("submitscript4.R")

The first time you run the submit script it will prompt you for your Submission login and Submission password. These can be found at the top of the Programming Assignments page. To execute the submit script, type

submit()

at the console prompt (after source-ing the file). NOTE that the submit script requires that you be connected to the Internet in order to work properly. When you execute the submit script in R, you will see the following menu (after typing in your submission login email and password)
